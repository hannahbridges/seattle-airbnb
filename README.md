# Seattle AirBnB Superhosts

## Installations
The code should run in the standard anaconda installation of python 3.x
Required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Project Motivation
This project aims to use Seattle AirBnB data to understand what it means to be a Superhost and answer 3 questions:
1. Does being a superhost lead to an increase in booking rate or listing price?
2. Are the amenities provided by superhosts different to those provided by non-superhosts?
3. Can we predict which listings belong to superhosts based on AirBnB listings data?

## File Descriptions
seattle-airbnb-project.ipynb includes all the code produced during this analysis

## Results
The findings of this analysis are described in a blogpost [here](https://medium.com/@hannahbridges1/airbnb-superhost-status-is-it-more-than-a-shiny-badge-72694ccb4a05).
